This file containds the dissasembled binary bomb code that I had to comb through and single step through to find the secret codes hidden in the machine code. There were all different kinds of data structures and address values that you had to have an indepth understanding of to be able to find the location of all the hidden codes. We also used tools like GDB debugger to single step through the program which allowed us to see into certain spots in memory and registers.
